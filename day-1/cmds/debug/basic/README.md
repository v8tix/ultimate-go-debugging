The error you're encountering indicates that GoLand is trying to use the `rr` (record and replay) tool for debugging, but it cannot find the `rr` executable on your system. `rr` is a tool developed by Mozilla that allows you to record the execution of a program and then replay it for debugging purposes.

To resolve this issue, you'll need to install `rr` and ensure that it's in your system's `PATH`. Here are the steps to do this:

### 1. **Install `rr`:**
- On **Ubuntu** or other Debian-based distributions, you can install `rr` using `apt`:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install rr
  ```
- On **Fedora**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install rr
  ```
- On **Arch Linux**:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S rr
  ```
- On **macOS**, `rr` is not officially supported, but you can try using it through a virtual machine or a Linux environment.

Alternatively, you can build `rr` from source by following the instructions on the official [Mozilla rr GitHub repository](https://github.com/mozilla/rr).

### 2. **Add `rr` to the PATH:**
After installing `rr`, make sure it's available in your `PATH`. You can check if `rr` is in your `PATH` by running:
   ```bash
   rr --version
   ```
If it returns the version information, then `rr` is correctly installed and in your `PATH`.

If it's not in your `PATH`, you can add it by editing your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):
   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/rr
   ```
Replace `/path/to/rr` with the actual path to the `rr` executable.

### 3. **Restart GoLand:**
After installing `rr` and adding it to your `PATH`, restart GoLand to ensure that the IDE picks up the changes.

### 4. **Configure GoLand to Use `rr`:**
- Open GoLand.
- Go to **Preferences** > **Build, Execution, Deployment** > **Debugger**.
- Make sure that the **Mozilla rr** option is enabled and correctly configured.

After completing these steps, you should be able to use the record and debug feature in GoLand without encountering the "Cannot find the mozilla rr executable" error.

The error you're seeing indicates that `rr` requires the `/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid` setting to be `1` or lower, but your system currently has it set to `4`. This setting controls the level of access to performance events (like CPU performance counters) that unprivileged users have.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue:

1. **Check the Current Value:**
   You can check the current value of `perf_event_paranoid` with the following command:
   ```bash
   cat /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
   ```
   If it's set to `4`, youâ€™ll need to change it.

2. **Temporarily Change the Value:**
   To change the value for the current session (this will revert after a reboot), run:
   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=1
   ```
   This command will lower the `perf_event_paranoid` value to `1`, which allows `rr` to work.

3. **Make the Change Permanent:**
   To make the change permanent across reboots, you can add it to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:
   ```bash
   echo "kernel.perf_event_paranoid=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
   sudo sysctl -p
   ```
   This will ensure that the setting is applied every time your system boots.

4. **Verify the Change:**
   After applying the change, you can verify it by running:
   ```bash
   cat /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
   ```
   It should now return `1`.

5. **Re-run GoLand with `rr`:**
   After adjusting the `perf_event_paranoid` setting, try using the record and debug feature in GoLand again. The issue should be resolved.

### Important Note:
- Setting `perf_event_paranoid` to `1` lowers the security level by allowing unprivileged users more access to performance counters, which could potentially expose system details to local users. If this is a concern, consider whether you need to revert this change after using `rr` or apply it only temporarily when necessary.

After these steps, you should be able to use `rr` within GoLand without encountering the previous error.
